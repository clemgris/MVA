# Course objectives
This course aims to provide an overview of the techniques used in machine learning for the study of time series, covering various tasks such as pattern extraction and recognition, anomaly detection, prediction, interpolation, etc. The course will extensively illustrate these techniques using real-world data and problems from current challenges, with a focus on understanding and interpreting the data.
## Themes
- Extract and recognize patterns
- Model and represent
- Detect changes and anomalies
- Data repair: denoising and interpolation of missing data
- Extract and select relevant features
- Manage multivariate data using graphs
