# Course objectives
This course involves exploring the structure of images at the patch level, focusing on dimensions ranging from 8x8 to 60x60. It aims to apply this understanding to tackle image denoising, a fundamental problem. Additionally, the course includes a comparison between human-designed image processing techniques and those learned by deep neural networks.
## Themes
- Separating noise and signal in signal and image processing.
- Exploration of classical theories and principles, as well as the emerging neural denoising algorithms that have started outperforming human-made algorithms.
- Understand of the inner workings of neural denoising networks, which learn jointly from noise and image structure using large image collections.
