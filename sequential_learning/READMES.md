# Course objectives
In online learning, data are acquired and treated on the fly; feedbacks are received and algorithms uploaded on the fly. This field has received a lot of attention recently because of the possible applications coming from internet. They include choosing which ads to display, repeated auctions, spam detection, experts/algorithm aggregation (and boosting), etc.
The objectives of the course (in English) is to introduce and study the main concepts (regret, calibration, etc.) of online learning, construct algorithms and show connection with game theory.
## Themes
- Regret minimization
- Calibration
- Exponential weights algorithms
- Stochastic Optimization
- Game Theory
