# Course objectives
Introduction to the models and mathematical tools used in formalizing the problem of learning and decision-making under uncertainty. In particular, we will focus on the frameworks of reinforcement learning and multi-arm bandit.
## Themes
- Historical multi-disciplinary basis of reinforcement learning
- Markov decision processes and dynamic programming
- Stochastic approximation and Monte-Carlo methods
- Function approximation and statistical learning theory
- Approximate dynamic programming
- Introduction to stochastic and adversarial multi-arm bandit
- Learning rates and finite-sample analysis
