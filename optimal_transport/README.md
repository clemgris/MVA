# Course objectives
This course reviews fundamental mathematical and numerical method for imaging sciences and machine learning. It starts by covering the basics of data representation and processing, including linear filtering and Wavelets. The core of the course is first order optimization methods (gradient descent, stochastic optimization and proximal splitting) with an emphasis on performance guarantees and their applications to inverse problems in imaging and supervised learning using linear models.
The last part of course covers more advanced problems related to the high dimensional setting, using in particular sparsity-inducing regularizers such as the Lasso and compressed sensing methods.

# Project

In this project, I studied the article [Wasserstein Robust Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13196) [Abdullah, M. A., Ren, H., Bou Ammar, H., Milenkovic, V., Luo, R., Zhang, M., & Wang, J. (2019)] and I conducted numerical experiments to test the method on simple tabular environments.
