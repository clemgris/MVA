# Optimal transport

In this project, I studied the article [Wasserstein Robust Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13196) [Abdullah, M. A., Ren, H., Bou Ammar, H., Milenkovic, V., Luo, R., Zhang, M., & Wang, J. (2019)] from the perspective of optimal transport. I conducted numerical experiments to test the method on simple tabular environments.
