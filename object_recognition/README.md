# Course Objective
Automated object recognition – and more generally scene analysis – from photographs and videos is the great challenge of computer vision. The objective of this course is to provide a coherent introductory overview of the image, object and scene models, as well as the methods and algorithms, used today to address this challenge.
## Themes

- Instance-level recognition: camera geometry, local-invariant features, correspondence, efficient visual search
- Category-level recognition: bags of features, sparse coding and dictionary learning
- Neural networks, optimization methods
- Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition
- Motion and human actions
- 3D object recognition
- Weakly-supervised learning for visual recognition
