# Course objectives
This course focuses on learning methods related to graphs in machine learning. It covers two main sources of graphs: those derived from networks (social, biological, technology, etc.) and those derived from flat data (such as vision data). Topics include spectral clustering, manifold learning, semi-supervised learning, online decision-making on graphs, scalability, and relevant mathematical concepts.
## Themes


   - Spectral graph theory,  graph Laplacians and spectral clustering
   - Constructing graphs from flat data – graphs as a non-parametric basis
   - Semi-supervised learning and manifold learning
   - Learnability on graphs – transductive learning
   - Adaptive online learning with graphs
   - Real-world graphs scalability and approximations
   - Large-graphs, approximation, sparsification and error analysis
   - Decision-making on graphs, graph bandits
   - Social networks and recommender systems applications
   - Vision applications (e.g., face recognition)
